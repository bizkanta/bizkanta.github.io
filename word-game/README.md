# BlackSwan_wordGame

### I made my word game application with the help of Angular JS.

### The game requests a word from the user:
- Checks, if the given word is on the list (if not, then notifies the user to type in a new one).
- It counts the unique letters within the word. The number of them is the score of the word. At this point, it notifies the user, that he/she got X points.
- Saves the given word and the score into a highscores board. The user can list the highscores on a separate page of the game, by clicking the 'Check highscores' button.
- The highscore list contains unique words only.

#### The game is saved when you navigate away, or refresh the page.

#### The game has different view for mobile and desktop.
